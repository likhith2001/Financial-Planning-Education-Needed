                    There are different types of investment in the market, and we have bifurcated them into three main
                    categories. They are: <br> <br>

                    1. Fixed income investments - Fixed income is an investment approach focused on preservation of
                    capital and income. It typically includes investments like government and corporate bonds, CDs and
                    money market funds. Fixed income can offer a steady stream of income with less risk than stocks.
                    <br><br>
                    2. Market linked investments - In simplest terms, theyâ€™re debt securities, or bonds, that have a
                    return that is linked to the
                    performance of another asset or assets. Like other corporate bonds, Market-Linked Investments are
                    issued for fixed terms, such as one to five years, and remain subject to issuer credit risk. Except
                    instead of paying you a traditional interest coupon, Market-Linked Investments provide you with
                    exposure to the performance of a market index, an individual stock, commodities, foreign exchange or
                    interest rates. Market-Linked Investments can be purchased in a new issue offering or in the
                    secondary market.
                    <br><br>
                    3. Other investments - Investments that do not come under fixed income or market-linked investments
                    are other investments. These are also called alternative investments.
